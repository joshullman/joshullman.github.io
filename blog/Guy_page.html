            I grew up in Santa Clarita.  I went to Boston University where I studied Film and Television.  After a brief stint of working at Sony I realized that I wanted a different kind of job.  Stumbled upon coding.  Love that shit.  Decide to pursue it and found Dev Bootcamp.  And here I am what's up.

            I believe in working together and communicating.  We're all a part of a big team and we all have a part to fill.  I love games and at my core I'm a problem solver.  I want to create things that help people.
