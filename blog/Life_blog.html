        <h2>Kitchen vs Table</h2>
        <h4>Week 1: 3/10/15</h4>

            So far, I love the DBC mindset and community.  I don't get the impression that the students are a means to and end for the DBC program.  Student's aren't just logo-wearing money machines that DBC pumps out every month to boost their own sales.  DBC isn't about numbers and vicious competition and "winning".  It's about creating well-rounded empathetic individuals.  It's about freethinkers and problem solvers.  They're not interested in creating consumers - they strive to create leaders.  DBC is subtly changing the programming landscape by equipping its graduates with knowledge and free will and independence and releasing them into the industry to infect others with their intoxicating philosophies.

            The Kitchen vs. Table comparison was incredible and I'm totally on board as a cook.  What amazed me was how similar the comparison was to open source vs closed source.  As westerners and capitalists, there's a huge emphasis on the importance of both sides (buying and selling) of consumerism.  In particular, we're constantly looking for a way to create a product or service to sell to other people.  It's "stupid" to create anything open source because, yknow, what's the point?  You put all your hard work into creating something just to give it away?  Why wouldn't you try to make money off of it?  It's a very closed, individualistic mindset.  It's the Table mindset.  Open source on the other hand is the Kitchen mindset.  It's not about what the product can do for YOU or how much YOU can grow by exploiting it.  It's about the group working together to create something better than they ever could have created individually.  It's about progress as a whole.  It's strange to imagine how far humanity and technology could go if we shared our collective breakthroughs instead of selling them to one another.

          I love this sort of culture.  I'm a bit shy so I worry about being able to actually contribute to a community like this.  With so many strong people out there, it's difficult to be heard.  I suppose I'll just have to be confident and trudge ahead into the unknown.
