        <h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <h4>Week 6: 4/24/15</h4>
          <p>The topic this week is "stereotype threat".  This is a phenomenon where individuals perform sub-par because of perceived stereotypes about themselves regarding a certain topic or fear of confirming a stereotype.  The most poignant example was that african american students tended to underperform when it came to tests where race was emphasized.  To be honest, I haven't really faced stereotype threat.  I'm a white male (which has its own set of issues) but I've never been under the pressure to "break free" from a pseduo-prophecy that follows me around.  Personally, I didn't even see how something like this could be applicable to the Dev Bootcamp program until I really thought about it.  So far all of my pairing sessions have been evenly comparable.  There's been no obvious deviation between women or men or races.  To be honest, I can't even think of any programmer stereotypes that someone would have to live up to.  Maybe I'm naiive.  I've faced language and communication barriers but that's all they are - communication barriers.  It's just a matter of being able to express yourself and your thoughts, not a matter of race or stereotypes.  Coding is pretty straightforward - good code is good code.  That's it.  There's no language barriers there - we're all speaking the same language.  I suppose what I'm getting at is that DBC is a safe place.  We're all disadvantaged.  We're all learning something together.  We're all here to support each other and we shouldn't be worried about things we can't change.  We should be moving forward together, so if anyone feels pressured just let us know!  We all want to succeed and I'm sure the group will accept any changes we can make to help you feel more comfortable :).

        <h2>Peer Pairing and Feedback</h2>
        <h4>Week 5: 4/17/15</h4>
          <p>
            One of the foundations of Dev Bootcamp is Peer Programming.  Peer Programming involves two programmers that work together on the same piece of code.  This system has many benefits - it allows programmers to brainstorm with each other, check each other's code, accomplish goals together quickly.  During each pairing session, one individual is assigned to a "Driver" role while the other is assigned to a "Navigator" role.  The Driver generally physically writes the code while the Navigator supervises for mistakes and researches potential solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working within this system is interesting.  I've found that the biggest hurdles aren't technical per se, but emotional/personal.  When my peer partner and I are on the same page and our personalities match up, we blow through the material.  Those situations are amazing because I'm not so worried about how I present myself and can focus on the code at hand.  When it's not such a smooth emotional pairing it takes more effort to communicate clearly.  This can be a bit distracting but it's just one of the inherent drawbacks of the system, especially when you're constantly revolving your peering partner.
          </p>
            <p>
            Feedback is another foundational element of DBC.  Feedback should always be three things: Actionable, Specific, and Kind.  Rules for feedback are new to me, but I agree with the premise.  Implementing it is another thing entirely.  It's difficult to give effective feedback that's all three of the above.  I also find it hard not to give advice.  Being vulnerable when giving and receiving feedback is a bit of a scary concept for most people but it's the most important part of clear communication.  If one side isn't being honest or if one side isn't open to change then the feedback won't be as effective or useful as it could hvae been.  Feedback is an incredibly important aspect of work and being able to clearly communicate is paramount.

        <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
        <h4>Week 4: 4/10/15</h4>
          <p>
            "The Future".  Plenty of times we say that "the future" is here or "the future" is now, but what does that actually mean?  So many technological breakthroughs are showered down upon us every year that our society is constantly in the process of catching up.  In a very scary and immediate way, technology is impacting and shaping our society NOW.  But is this change a good thing or a bad thing?  Is it the inventors's responsibility to consider the repercussions of his or her inventions?  Or is it the consumer's?  Or even the Government's?  What is the price of "progress"?  The quote that comes to mind is from Jurassic Park - a classic technological cautionary tale - "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn't stop to think if they should."  
          </p>
            <p>
            This post is titled "Autonomous Vehicles" and don't get me wrong - I'm not against the idea.  The reason I chose this topic to research is because I think it's a great idea.  I found it hard to see any negatives - it's safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly.  The benefits are enormous for those who can afford them.  So then what are the cons?  I'll start the list with jobs.  The automotive industry is huge across the globe.  If we were to replace every car with an autonomous counterpart, there would be an economic collapse overnight.  Cab drivers, taxi drivers, manufacturers - all unemployed.  Also think about cyber safety/technological problems.  These cars rely heavily on GPS and wireless communication.  Imagine that a GPS goes out?  Worst case scenario would be massive accidents and casualties.  Best case scenario would be that everyone's car shuts down, but a ton of people are stranded.  A huge inconvenience.  Imagine, on the darker side, that a terrorist was able to hack into a GPS satellite or controlling mechanism.  He or she would have access to thousands of cars and could wreck widespread havoc with them.  Does the benefit of such a system outweigh the potential cons?  It's a difficult topic to consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            All technical advances come with a price.  But whose responsibility is it to consider the repercussions of change?  Do we just throw our inventions into the chaos of our society and figure "whatever happens, happens" or do we have a responsibility to consider the drawbacks of our actions?  Food for thought.

        <h2>Thinking Style</h2>
        <h4>Week 3: 4/3/15</h4>
          <p>
            My thinking style is Abstract Sequential.  According to the Gregorc Model, I like to have my point to be heard, analyzing situations before making a decision or acting, and applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems.  This is all very true for me.  I hate being shut down and disregarded, I like to take time to think through a problem, and I love solving problems/puzzles (this is why I'm at DBC lol).  I learn bess when I have access to references, I'm placed in a stimulating environment, and I'm able to work alone.  Yes, yes, and yes.  As useful as memorization is, I prefer to have repositories to look up the information I need.  There was a philosopher who once said that people are as intelligent as the resources at their disposal, and I think that's true.  There's so much information right here at our fingertips, why not use it to solve problems?  I also like time to work alone.  I like to take my puzzle and mess around with it in the corner.  Sometimes when I'm working in groups, I need to take some time out to think about a problem on my own.  As far as Phase 0 has gone so far, I haven't really felt the need to withdraw from my peers yet.  This might be a problem in the future, especially in group work, and I'll have to be prepared to handle this.  I've had a couple issues with expressing my emotions but it's something I'm working on.  Being diplomatic is something I'll definitely need to work on as well, especially on campus.  Embracing the growth mindset and actively using it is incredibly important.  It's very easy to fall into a fixed minset and it takes a conscious effort to filter out those negative impulses.  So far, Phase 0 has been only somewhat challenging for me, but that's mostly because of my thinking style.  I'm able to retreat and solve problems alone, so my real challenge will be facing my weaknesses on campus with other students.  I'm doing my best to prepare myself for DBC but I suppose we'll have to wait until I'm on campus to see if I prepared myself enough.

        <h2>Kitchen vs Table</h2>
        <h4>Week 1: 3/10/15</h4>
          <p>
            So far, I love the DBC mindset and community.  I don't get the impression that the students are a means to and end for the DBC program.  Student's aren't just logo-wearing money machines that DBC pumps out every month to boost their own sales.  DBC isn't about numbers and vicious competition and "winning".  It's about creating well-rounded empathetic individuals.  It's about freethinkers and problem solvers.  They're not interested in creating consumers - they strive to create leaders.  DBC is subtly changing the programming landscape by equipping its graduates with knowledge and free will and independence and releasing them into the industry to infect others with their intoxicating philosophies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kitchen vs. Table comparison was incredible and I'm totally on board as a cook.  What amazed me was how similar the comparison was to open source vs closed source.  As westerners and capitalists, there's a huge emphasis on the importance of both sides (buying and selling) of consumerism.  In particular, we're constantly looking for a way to create a product or service to sell to other people.  It's "stupid" to create anything open source because, yknow, what's the point?  You put all your hard work into creating something just to give it away?  Why wouldn't you try to make money off of it?  It's a very closed, individualistic mindset.  It's the Table mindset.  Open source on the other hand is the Kitchen mindset.  It's not about what the product can do for YOU or how much YOU can grow by exploiting it.  It's about the group working together to create something better than they ever could have created individually.  It's about progress as a whole.  It's strange to imagine how far humanity and technology could go if we shared our collective breakthroughs instead of selling them to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love this sort of culture.  I'm a bit shy so I worry about being able to actually contribute to a community like this.  With so many strong people out there, it's difficult to be heard.  I suppose I'll just have to be confident and trudge ahead into the unknown.
