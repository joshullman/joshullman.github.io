        <h2>Git, GitHub, and Version Control</h2>
        <h4>Week 1: 3/20/15</h4>
          <p>
            Alright, so here we go.  Week 1 has been a whirlwind - lots of stuff to talk about.  Since I doubt anyone's going to read this, I'm going to teach this to my imaginary friend(?) Jimmy.  Hey Jimmy, how are you doing?  "I'm doing pretty well, been kind of a crazy day.  I went to Pottery Barn earlier-" Okay - Jimmy?  "Yeah?" Let's just stay focused on the coding stuff for now, okay?  "Oh yeah - Got it. 10-4.  Loud and clear.  I can totally do that." Just...okay, I'm just going to start talking now.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are the benefits of version control?  Great question, Jimmy.  "Huh?".  Version control is a tool that lets you record your project progress at any given point.  And it's awesome.  Why is it so awesome?  Errors and mistakes in your code/methodology are like viruses.  Sometimes you don't know that you're sick (or that your project is flawed) until it's irreparable.  "Impossible - I've purified my body in the waters of Lake Minnetonka-" Well not everyone's perfect like you, Jimmy. Version control lets you figure out the exact moment that the virus/error entered your system and allows you to continue from that moment as though you were never sick in the first place.  Pretty cool huh?  Another way to think of it is as a "save station".  "Like a video game?!"  No Jimmy, not like...well yes.  Kind of exactly like that.  It lets you save your progress before you make a big decision, explore multiple paths, and decide which path yields the best results.  It's like your very own mobile multiverse!  Very cool!
          </p>
          <p>
            "That is cool."  Of course it is Jimmy.  "But there's no such thing as a real life save station...is there?!"  Oh Jimmy.  So naiive.  For programmers, there is a wonderful tool just like that.  It's called Git!  How does Git help you keep track of changes?  Git has a ton of cool features to help you organize your project.  Git is in a constant state of comparing your work to the master branch.  In a way, when you work in Git, you're working in an alternate reality.  You can do anything you'd like and Git will keep track off everything you do and all of the changes you make.  "Hey, just like Sting!  It'll be watching you!"  Hopefully not in a questionably weird way, Jimmy.  Anyway, when you've made all of your changes/additions, Git lets you approve/package them and then commit the changes to the project.  It then updates the master branch and voila!  You've got a stew going!
          </p>
          <p>
            "So that's all cool and stuff...but that sounds so lonley!  :(!  What if I want you, my best friend, to give me your world-renouned feedback on my code?  Is there a way for me to show my brilliant creations..." Heh "...to other people?" Jimmy, just when I thought you couldn't get any dumber, you go and say that...and totally redeem yourself!  There is a place exactly like that!  It's called Github!  GitHub adds a whole new awesome layer to the collaboration process.  You remember Version Control and Git and keeping track of changes?  Well GitHub makes it all accessable virtually!  "Whaaaat?  You don't have to sit next to each other or physically connect your computers or-" No!  Not any more!  GitHub is essentially a hosting service that allows you to upload your code to a centralized server.  Your master branch can live in the free unbridled pastures of GitHub while you (and many many others!) can access it, change it, comment on it, collaborate through it, do whatever you want to it - virtually!  How freakin' awesome is that?!  Just imagine how many whiny programmers it shushed up.  Hah.  Good times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, this has been your Week 1 update with Josh!  "and Jimmy!".  Just- Josh...okay.  Hope you guys learned something!  I'll probably be back next week, so stay tuned!  "What time?"  I'll let you know.  "So like...friday?" I mean, hopefully.  "Any way you can give me like a guestimation or-" NO JIMMY, I DON'T KNOW! "Well jeez, I didn't mean to..."  Ha.  Oh, Jimmy.  This is going to be...fun.
